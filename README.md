## Replacement controller board for IBM Model M Keyboard

The [IBM Enhanced Keyboard (Model
M)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_M_keyboard) is widely
considered the best keyboard for its typing experience. First produced
in 1985, it was made of high quality materials and is very
durable. IBM produced over 10 millions units, and because of their
durability, there are still many working keyboards today.

However, those keyboards were designed for the [PS/2
port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PS/2_port), which is rarely seen
in recent computers. Some units that were shipped with terminals even
used a RJ-45 interface. As a result, it can be difficult to use this
keyboard with modern computers.

If you want to enjoy the great typing experience of an IBM Model M on a modern computer, you have basically 3 choices:

1. You can buy a new unit with a USB interface at [Unicomp](https://www.pckeyboard.com/page/product/NEW_M).
2. You can use an active [PS/2 to USB converter](https://www.clickykeyboards.com/product/ps-2-to-usb-adapter-converter-for-keyboards/). That solution will not work for RJ-45 Model Ms, though.
3. You can replace the original controller with a new one supporting USB. That is what this project does.
